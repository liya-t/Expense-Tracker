# Expense-Tracker

## Overview
Expense-Tracker helps you split the group expenses. Register and login to account to create a group and add members to the group. The total amount spent and the name of the group member who paid the expense can be selected in the table. The individual expenses page helps add individual expenditure and the comments will be generated with expense split.

The project was developed using ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB integration using Mongoose and ExpressJS.
